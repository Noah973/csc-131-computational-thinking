# CSC 131 - Computation Thinking
## Lab 0

For this lab, you will practice the lab work procedure. Do the following:

 1. Write a function named `helloWorld()` that prints the message "Hello world!"
 
 2. Write a function named `favoriteFood()` that prints out your favorite food.
	
 3. Write a function named `myHobbies()` that prints out two things that you like to do.
 
 4. Write a function. Its name and purpose is up to you - be creative!
 
 5. Write a function named `main()` that calls the four functions specified above, in the order written. 


Paste the following into the bottom of your file, then run the file to test your code:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # execute only if run as a script
    main()
```

A sample program run is as follows:

```
Hello world!
My favorite food is macaroni and cheese.
I like to play games (of the video- and tabletop- varieties) and read books.
Your lucky number today is... 57
```

The format of the output of your program (aside from the up-to-you function) must be as in the sample run. When you are done, demonstrate your code to ***two other students in the class*** and the instructor and upload your solution to your CSC131 upload folder in a folder called LABS. Please name your file `lab0.py`.
