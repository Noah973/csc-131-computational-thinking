## Parameter Passing Reference Materials

### Lecture Slides
 * [Parameter Passing: The awful truth revealed](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10f-jGyKdsda9y0E36hARhvKKCDfMMTDwbYOeqNC0ZJY/edit?usp=sharing)

### Python Scripts
 * [why_use_functions.py](why_use_other_functions.py)
 * [parameter_passing.py](parameter_passing.py)

### External Reference
 * [Is Python call-by-value or call-by-reference? Neither.](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/is-python-callbyvalue-or-callbyreference-neither/) - Informative blog post that delves into how python parameter passing (and variable assignment in general) works. Some of what the author references will probably be unfamiliar to you, and I don't expect it all to make perfect sense the first time through. However, working through it, talking about it, asking questions, etc. until you understand will make you stronger as both a programmer and a learner!
 * [Python's official tutorial about function definitions and parameter types](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions) - Fairly technical but very thorough look at function definitions and all of the different ways parameters can be passed into them.
