## Parameter Passing Reference Materials

### Lecture Slides
 * [Parameter Passing: The awful truth revealed](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10f-jGyKdsda9y0E36hARhvKKCDfMMTDwbYOeqNC0ZJY/edit?usp=sharing)

### Python Scripts
 * [why_use_functions.py](./why_use_functions.py)
 * [parameter_passing.py](./parameter_passing.py)

### External Reference
 * [Python tuples are immutable but may change](https://standupdev.com/wiki/doku.php?id=python_tuples_are_immutable_but_may_change) - Excellent article that explains the ideas of mutability and immutability. These concepts are very strongly tied to variable assignment, and by extension, parameter passing. I **highly**, **highly**, ***highly*** recommend you read this article outside of class. Understanding these concepts strengthen your foundational understanding of both Python and programming in general.
 * [Mutable and Immutable Objects](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/mutable-and-immutable-objects/) - Article discussing mutable and immutable types in greater detail. An extension and elaboration on the details brought up in the above article, also highly recommended reading.
 * [Python's official tutorial about function definitions and parameter types](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions) - Fairly technical (but very thorough) look at function definitions and all of the different ways parameters can be passed into them.
