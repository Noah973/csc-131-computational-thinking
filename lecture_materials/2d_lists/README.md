## 2D Lists Reference Materials

### Lecture Slides
 * [2D Lists: Otherwise known as Lisddts](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lwd_eRbvF64LalRs72YJXscH2KmUlBbrCSoqnH-JZ9w/edit?usp=sharing)

### Python Scripts
 * [matrix.py](./matrix.py)

### External Reference
 * [Python's official tutorial introduction to lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) - Should be a good review of the basics of how lists works. Mentions 2D (nested) lists at the end of the section.
 * [Python's official tutorial detailed discussion of lists] (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) - Nice refresher on the things a list can do, and examples of different use cases they can handle.
 * [Python documentation on sequence types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range) - Lists are sequences, so they can take advantage of the different built in functionalities referenced here.
